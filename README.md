# Ballistics Calculator
React app to calculate ballistic trajectories

Run `npm install` to load the necessary dependencies. Run `npm start` to start a local React server. The app can be accessed in your browser at https://localhost:3000

At this time in development, only a few of the entry fields have effect on the calculator:
- Muzzle Velocity
- Horizontal Distance
- Vertical Distance
- Altitude ASL
- Shot Angle
- Scope Height

Edit these values to generate a new ballistic trajectory with accompanying figures.

A live demo of this calculator can be found at https://ubershotz.com/calc.html
